A personal Discord bot, still in development for my self learning objectives

Significant tools used so far in this project (server side) :
- Java & Spring Boot
- [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J), a reactive library to develop discord bots for Java
- MongoDB and Rest APIs to collect/store data ([Riot Games public API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and [HenrikDev's API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Henrik-3/HenrikDev-API/3.0.0#/))


Frontend (JS/TS with React and Vite) is being developed in the corresponding branches
